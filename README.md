# NOvA
All my codes Related to NOvA.

Airshower codes are part of my PhD dissertation research on cosmic ray airshowers. The plots are blessed by the NOvA Collaboration and approved for public display by Fermilab Export Control (FERMILAB-POSTER-25-0171-PPD). They were used in a poster presentation at the International Neutrino Summer School 2025 at Fermilab.
