# NOvA
This repository contains some of my sample codes related to NOvA.

Airshower codes are part of my PhD dissertation research on cosmic ray airshowers. The plots are blessed by the NOvA Collaboration and approved for public display by Fermilab Export Control (FERMILAB-POSTER-25-0171-PPD). They were used in a poster presentation at the International Neutrino Summer School 2025 at Fermilab.

PeripheralNumu codes are also related to another dissertation project. They are written using C++ based CAFAna and ROOT framework.
